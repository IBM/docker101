## **Optional:** Use play-with-docker

If you don't want to install Docker, an alternative is to use [Play-With-Docker](http://play-with-docker.com). Play-With-Docker is a website where you can run terminals directly from your browser that have Docker installed. All of the labs for this course can be run on Play-With-Docker, though we recommend installing docker locally on your host, so that you can continue your docker journey when this course has completed. To use Play-With-Docker, navigate to [Play-With-Docker](http://play-with-docker.com) in your browser.

## Summary

By installing Docker, or alternatively, familiarizing yourself with [Play with Docker](http://play-with-docker.com), you are ready to complete the remaining labs in this course.
