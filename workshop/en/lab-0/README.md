# Lab 0 - Install Docker

## Overview

In this lab, you will install docker. We will be using docker throughout the rest of the labs.

### Prerequisites

None

## Step 1: Install Docker

1. Navigate to [store.docker.com](http://store.docker.com),

1. Select "Community Edition" or "Docker CE"

    Docker comes with two flavors of installations. The "paid" version is Docker Enterprise Edition (Docker EE), and the "free" version is Docker Community Edition (Docker CE). We will be using only free features provided by the Docker Community Edition for this course.

1. Select the filters for your operating system or platform

On this page you will find the installation for your operating systems. For example, if you are using a Mac, select "MacOS", to find the installation for the Mac platform.

## **Optional:** Use play-with-docker

If you don't want to install Docker, an alternative is to use [Play-With-Docker](http://play-with-docker.com). Play-With-Docker is a website where you can run terminals directly from your browser that have Docker installed. All of the labs for this course can be run on Play-With-Docker, though we recommend installing docker locally on your host, so that you can continue your docker journey when this course has completed. To use Play-With-Docker, navigate to [Play-With-Docker](http://play-with-docker.com) in your browser.

## Summary

By installing Docker, or alternatively, familiarizing yourself with [Play with Docker](http://play-with-docker.com), you are ready to complete the remaining labs in this course.
